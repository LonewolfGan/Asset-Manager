# i18n Review Checklist

Use this reference for broad locale additions, translation review, or release-oriented localization work. Apply only items relevant to the project and requested scope.

## Coverage

- Inventory the user-visible surfaces in scope.
- Confirm every intended translation candidate is represented by the project i18n mechanism.
- Distinguish deliberate source-language preservation from accidental untranslated text.
- Report dynamic/external/non-text surfaces that cannot be verified from repository resources.

## Resource integrity

- Required keys exist in the locales covered by the task.
- No unrelated locale entries were deleted or rewritten.
- Value types match where the resource format requires them to match.
- Empty translations are intentional or reported.
- Generated locale resources are regenerated only through the project-approved command.

## Message contracts

- Named placeholders and ICU/select arguments are preserved.
- Markup, escapes, formatting tokens, and intentional line breaks remain valid.
- Plural/select branches follow the project's library and locale rules.
- Sentences are not built from fragments that assume source-language word order.

## Language quality

- Meaning and user intent match the source.
- Terminology is consistent with existing product language and glossary decisions.
- Short labels are interpreted using screen/action context, not in isolation.
- Tone, formality, capitalization, and punctuation fit the target locale and existing product voice.
- Brand/product names and deliberately preserved terms remain unchanged.
- High-risk ambiguity is surfaced for human confirmation.

## Locale behavior

When applicable, verify:

- default locale;
- explicit locale switching;
- persistence across reload/restart;
- unsupported-locale fallback;
- missing-key fallback;
- lazy-loaded resource behavior;
- date/time/number/currency/unit formatting;
- locale normalization such as `en-US` vs `en` according to project rules.

## UI and accessibility

When affected, check:

- narrow-screen overflow;
- wrapping, truncation, and fixed-height containers;
- buttons/tabs/badges with longer translations;
- CJK line-breaking and font glyphs;
- screen-reader/accessibility labels;
- RTL direction and mirroring only when RTL locales are in scope.

## Evidence and limitations

A passing resource check proves only what it actually checked. It does not by itself prove:

- translation quality;
- runtime locale switching;
- visual correctness;
- complete coverage of inline/dynamic/non-text content;
- correct external/CMS content.

State those limitations explicitly when they matter.
